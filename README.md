### The AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Description
---
The first step is to create a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects. Create this interpreter with the aid of the cmd module.

The objects generated will be stored in a json file and accessed with the json module.

### Command Interpreter Description
---
The command interpreter is similar to the Bash shell. Its functionality is limited to use cases for the AirBnb website

Available commands are:

show
create
update
destroy
count

The command line interpreter can also perform the following actions:

Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
Updating attributes of an object
Destroying an object

### Getting Started
